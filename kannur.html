    <h2>Kannur</h2>
    <p>Kannur also known by its English Name – Cannanore is a Municipal Corporation in the Kannur district. Situated 518 km from the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram, Kannur is the 6th largest state of Kerala and 27th largest in India.
        
        The northern coast of Kerala is way less touristy than its southern coast. This is an attraction in its every right. The major draw card of this end of the coastal Kerala is the underdeveloped but very beautiful beaches found here. Besides this the enthralling theyyam possession rituals conducted here are also equally magnificent.
        
        During the role of the Kolathiri rajas, Kannur was the key port that was brimming with the international trade. Kannur was then also christened as the ‘great emporium of spice trade’ by the explorer Marco Polo. Ever since then, the regular colonial suspects such as the British, Dutch and Portuguese have gone a step ahead to exert their influence on this region. Presently, Kannur is an unexciting yet consenting town of Kerala that is largely known for its cashew trade and the weaving industry. Given the fact that Kannur is predominantly, a Muslim area, the tourists must keep in mind their culture and traditions and further act accordingly.</p>
